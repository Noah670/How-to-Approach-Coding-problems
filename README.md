# How-to-Approach-Coding-problems
This is a short guide on how to approach program requirements and break down the process of writing code into 3 main steps.

Any program or application can be broken down to a couple simple steps. This will help explain how you can translate program requirements into code and logic for any programming language.

Writing out code to solve a specfiic problems in the right order just like a recipe:

That order is typically:

1.) Input

2.) Processing

3.) Output


Almost every single program in existence has the same main steps at a higher level.
