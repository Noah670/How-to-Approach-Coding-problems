# How-to-Approach-Coding-problems
This is a short guide on how to approach program requirements and break down the process of writing code into 3 main steps.

Any program or application can be broken down to a couple simple steps. This will help explain how you can translate program requirements into code and logic for any programming language.

Writing out code to solve a specfiic problems in the right order just like a recipe:

That order is typically:

1.) Input
// The keyboard, mouse, touchscreen, file, microphone, light, etc...

2.) Processing
// calculate, translate, parse,

3.) Output
Output to a screen, print, play a sound, to a file, etc...


Almost every single program in existence has the same main steps at a higher level and you can apply this to any set of requirments you are given.
